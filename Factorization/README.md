# Factorization method to recover shape and motion #

Original problem is decribed in problem.pdf, problem 3. This is a HW from a Stanford CV class.

The factorization method is published by Tomasi and Kanade, Shape and motion from image streams under orthography: A factorization method. IJCV, 9(2):137-154, November 1992.

***SFM_factorization.cpp*** is the main file.

***myCVLib.h*** and ***myCVLib.cpp*** provide helper functions for solving the problem.

***set1/pt_2D_1.txt*** and ***set1/pt_2D_2.txt*** are the projections of feature points in two cameras.

***set1/pt_3D.txt*** contain the true 3D positions of the feature points.

Some other presentation slides are provided for reference.
